# Title (replace with your title)

A Social Security Number (SSN) is a 9-digit number, typically formatted as three groups of numbers separated by hyphens: xxx-xx-xxxx.

There are approximately 453.7 million different sequences available for assignment. The Department of Social Security claims it uses 5.5. million new numbers annually, and statisticians say that the nine-digit SSN allows for approximately 1 billion possible combinations.

Assigned at birth, the SSN enable government agencies to identify individuals in their records and businesses to track financial information. Interestingly, the SSN sequences are not recycled according to the Department, and upon an individual's death the number is removed from the active files and is not reused. Recycling sequences may become an issue someday, and with analytics, we may be able to predict exactly when.

Today, SSNs issues are random numbers, but that wasn't always the case. Before 2011, they were assigned regionally and in batches which limited the number of SSNs available for issuance to individuals by state. Before 2011, the nine-digit SSN was traditionally divided into 3 parts:

1) Area Numbers (*xxx*-xx-xxxx): first 3 digits originally represented the state in which a person first applied for a Social Security card.

2) Group Numbers (xxx-*xx*-xxxx): middle 2 digits were simply used to break all the SSNs with the same area number into smaller blocks.

3) Serial Numbers (xxx-xx-*xxxx*): last 4 digits within each group designation ran consecutively from 0001 through 9999.
